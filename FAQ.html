            <h2>What is this website?</h2>
            <p>This is a website for creating speedrun guides that can be shared with others.<br>There is no standard format for speedrun guides at the moment, and It's my goal to change that.</p>

            <h2>What is speedrunning?</h2>
            <p>A speedrun is a play-through of a video game performed with the intention of completing it as fast as possible within one's own ability.<br>Speedruns may cover a whole game or a selected part, such as a single level.</p>

            <h2>How does this guide work?</h2>
            <p>This guide breaks a video game down into sections.<br>Each section has a set of instructions that must be completed until you move unto the next section.<br>
            <h3>Naming the guide</h3>
            <p>In the top left of the "Create a guide" page, you can input the name of the guide. Be careful, you can only do this once.<br>The guide cannot be finished until a name for the guide is entered.</p>
            <h3>Naming a section</h3>
            <p>Above the "Add column", "Delete column", and "Add section" buttons is an input field for the name of the section.<br>You cannot add another section until the current section has been named.</p>
            <h3>Working with the Instruction Field</h3>
            <p>Click the "Add column" button to add a column to the Instruction Field. You can have a total of three columns.<br>Click the "Delete column" button to delete a column. This deletes them in the order that they were added.<br>Click the "Add section" button when you are finished with the current section and want to add another.<br>Adding a section deletes any unused textareas, so don't worry about filling up every input field.</p>
            <h3>Finshing the guide</h3>
            <p>Once you are finished making the guide, click the "FINISH" button in the top right corner.<br>Leave any fields that you do not want blank, they will be deleted upon finishing.</p>
            <h2>Using the guide</h2>
            <p>When you are ready to use the guide, click the start button. This starts a timer that will keep track of your progress.<br> Press the "a" button your keyboard to move through the guide easily.<br>When you do this, it appends the time that you finished the current section below the section name and moves to the next section.</p>
            <h2>How do I share this with others?</h2>
            <p>After you have finished making a guide and it is in it's functional state, right click on the page and click "Save as..."<br>This will give you an HTML file and a folder for the javascript and CSS.<br> With these, simply share them with your friends or post them on the internet for everyone to use!</p>
            <p>This line is for testing the githook trigegrs on Jenkins! This test will copy files to the /var/www/html directory (test 3)</p>
